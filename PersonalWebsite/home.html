                        I am a husband and father before all other things. I have been married to my beautiful wife Sara
                        for 9
                        years. We have two kids, Patrick is our oldest at 7.
                        Our daughter Lillian turned 5 in September 2022. I love spending time with my family no matter
                        if just
                        sitting and watching TV or going on an adventure in Michigan's Upper
                        Peninsula. I would not trade the bond we have for anything in the world.

                            I am always on the move, always looking for the next learning opportunity or fun adventure.
                            Because of this
                            I have a number of hobbies that I am proficient in ranging from
                            amateur meteorology, and wild mushroom foraging to gardening specifically growing Atlantic
                            Giant
                            pumpkins.

                    <p class="pText">
                        Growing up I have always had a love and aptitude for building. This could be anything from toys
                        to
                        eventually houses and fine woodworking in my shop. This ability to
                        understand visually in my head is what led me to software development. I can picture the design
                        in my
                        head
                        like I was building a table or a wall. I have found so many
                        parallels to physically building something to building a program with code.

                        My goal and desire is to use my skills and continue my learning and growth to advance in the
                        software
                        development profession and define myself as a leader. I will work until
                        this goal is achieved.
